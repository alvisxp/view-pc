### What are point clouds? 
Point clouds are a set of 3 dimensonal points representing a surface or an object, with each point representing it's position in 3D space (X, Y, X) or other additional information like color (R, G, B), surface normals, intensity, labels, GPS coordinates and etc depending on the device used to capture.

There are several file formats to store point cloud data, some of the commonly used ones are the following:
* *`pcd`*
* *`ply`*
* *`npy, npz`*
* *`bin`*
* *`txt`*
* *`laz,las`*

### Visualize point clouds 
This repo consists of *`.py`* files you can use to quickly visualize point clouds of each format, along with its requirements.
